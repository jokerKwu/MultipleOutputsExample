INFO:

This example shows usage of MultipleOutputs feature of Hadoop Map Reduce and custom code to achieve same funcionality, output to multiple files for M/R jobs.

You can read my blog post for more informations: http://vanjakom.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/hadoop-multipleoutputs-feature/

INSTALL:

1. Your hadoop configuration should be linked to /etc/hadoop/conf ( Cloudera distribution is already doing that ) - this can be modified by editing bin/run.sh
2. I'm using CDH3u0 Hadoop distibution, you probably can change this by editing pom
3. do mvn clean package
4. upload data/sample.txt to hdfs ( I will assume hdfs://localhost/user/hadoop/test/sample.txt )

RUN:

For usage of native MultipleOutputs feature do:

bin/run.sh native hdfs://localhost/user/hadoop/test/sample.txt hdfs://localhost/user/hadoop/test/
out_native/

For usage of custom code do:

bin/run.sh custom hdfs://localhost/user/hadoop/test/sample.txt hdfs://localhost/user/hadoop/test/out_custom/
